              <p> bedroom or bathroom has different cleaning needs and requires different materials to clean it. Having all the right</p>
                <p> materials on hand can often be difficult because we don’t always know what materials we need to have for every occassion.</p>

            <img src="images/Microfiber-cloth-1536x1024.jpg"width=700px height="400px">
            <p>Microfibre cloths are super handy around the house. With a little bit of water or cleaning solution,</p>
                <p>they can help clean most surfaces. What gives microfibre cloths their edge over regular cloths is their texture.</p>
                <p> Unlike other types of cloths, these are far less likely to leave behind scratches or streaks on more delicate</p>
                 <p> surfaces such as TV screens and windows.</p>

              <p>Take it from us, microfibre cloths are a no-brainer!</p>

            <img src="images/Make-your-house-smell-good-All-spray-household-cleaner.jpg"width=700px height="400px">
            <p>It’s always helpful to have one of these lying around the house. You can either fill them up with water </p>
              <p>to provide a little more moisture to the area you’re cleaning or use them to make your own cleaning solution. </p>  
                <p>They also help you avoid dripping water or cleaning solution in other areas of your home!</p></p>

            <p>If you’re like the rest of us, you won’t like the thought of dirt, lint and other particles flying around your home.</p>
               <p>This is where a good old fashioned broom and dustpan combination come in handy.</p>  
                <p>You might say ‘don’t I have a hoover for this?’ Good question. Hoovers do an excellent job in cleaning away dust. </p>
              <p> However, when it comes to larger particles small surface areas to clean, it becomes more effective to simply</p> 
               <p> scoop up with a broom and dustpan rather than to haul a bulky vacuum cleaner to the other side of the house.</p>
          </div>

            <img src="images/Vacuum-on-messy-carpet.jpg"width=700px height="400px">
            <p>Although a broom and dustpan work better for smaller areas and larger particles, when it comes to removing dust from your home,</p>
                 <p>here is no substitute for a good hoover.Hoovers effectively remove dust, dirt, pet hair and other undesirable particles </p>
              <p>from both the air and floor surfaces in your home. Some hoovers are also fitted with a HEPA filter that helps remove pollen. </p>   
               <p>This can help reduce the risk of allergic reactions at home.</p>

          <div>
            <h1 style="color: black;">5.Moop and bucket</h1>
            <img src="images/Mom-on-wooden-floor.jpeg"width=700px height="400px">
            <p>Even though a broom and hoover can help keep your hardwood floors fairly clean, they can be less effective when dealing</p>
                <p>with stubborn dirt and grime.This is where our mop and bucket come in. Not only do these effectively clean dirt and grime, </p> 
                <p>that they also make your floors shine, helping you make that killer first impression.</p>

            <img src="images/Red-toothbrush-1024x635.jpg"width=700px height="400px">
            <p>As great as a scrub brush is, its size prevents it from removing stains from more difficult to reach areas. This is where an old toothbrush comes in handy.</p>
              <p> Once you’ve disinfected an old toothbrush, you can use this and a little bit of cleaning liquid to get rid of those pesky stains hiding in the nooks and </p> 
              <p>crannies of your home. Another use of an old toothbrush is to remove limescal</p>

             <p>again is forgetting to clean their sponges. This causes germs and bacteria to build up on the sponge,</p>
