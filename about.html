                </h1>
    <p>At Glimmr, we’ve built an online platform to make it super simple to book the highest quality house and</p>
   <P> office cleaners within 60 seconds. You’ll find that our cleaners not only are extremely experienced, but they
    <P> all speak English, are very friendly and reliable.</P>
    <P>We pride ourselves on only taking on the top 2% of applicants onto our platform which includes interviews</P>
    <P>in-person test cleans to ensure that only the most friendly and professional cleaners come to your home or office.</P>
    <P>We’ve also looked to go above and beyond with our exceptional Customer Happiness Team who will make</P>
     <P>sure that all calls and emails are answered immediately and listen to any concerns you may have. Our aim is</P>
     <P>to bring you the perfect experience. If there is anything you’re not happy with, let us know and we’ll do our</P>
     <P>very best to make things right. </P>
     <P>Payments are all done online and you can book it as a regular or one-time clean all from the click of a button</P>
     <P>on the platform. If you’re off on holiday or need to skip a booking, it can be done very easily as well.</P>
     <P>So what are you waiting for? Book now online or over the phone and we’ll send you the best cleaners the UK</P>
     <P>has to offer.</P>

            </h1>
           <P>We built Glimmr with the intention to bring a high quality cleaning service to the whole of the UK. We’re</P>
           <P>young, but have grown super quickly and have a fantastic team of really nice and hard working people</P>
           <P>working here. We all know how busy you are with everything that is going on in your lives, be it work,</P>
           <P>family or hanging out with friends. Often the last thing people want to do is the cleaning, but we all know</P>
           <P>how important it is. </P>
           <P>We started in London but have expanded into pretty much every city across the UK (e.g. Birmingham,</P>
           <P>Edinburgh, Cambridge, etc). We’ve also gone from House Cleaning to Offices, Gyms, and every other type</P>
           <P>of cleaning out there. Our aim is to become the go-to company for cleaning related services! We have no</P>
           <P>contract or hidden charges - just a hard working and friendly team. </P>
           <p>Our entire business relies on repeat custom! So we’re super aware that we need to have a high quality</p>
           <P>service from not only our cleaners but also the customer experience you receive from the moment you</P>
           <p>book (be it on the phone or website) right until after the clean has finished. </p>
